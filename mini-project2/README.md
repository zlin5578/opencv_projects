# ðŸŽ¥ Webcam Video Processor

## ðŸ“š Assignment Overview

This project is a part of **Assignment 2-2: Playing with Camera**, for the Computer Vision course. The application allows users to apply real-time image processing effects to video input from a file using OpenCV in Python. Users can interact with the video by toggling various effects via keyboard input.
