# OpenCV Projects Collection

This repository contains a series of computer vision mini-projects and assignments, primarily using Python and OpenCV. Each project explores different aspects of image processing, object detection, and real-time video analysis. Below is a summary of each project:

---

## assignment9

- **RCNN**: Implements multi-class object recognition using R-CNN architectures (VGG16 and MobileNet). Includes webcam integration for real-time detection and performance optimization.
- **YOLO**: Contains YOLO-based object detection experiments for fast, real-time recognition.

---

## mini-project1

- **bluescreen.py**: Demonstrates background subtraction and compositing using blue screen techniques.
- **simpleimage.py**: Basic image manipulation and processing functions.
- **imageexamples.py**: Example scripts for image loading, displaying, and simple effects.

---

## mini-project2

- **assignment2-1.py**: Real-time webcam video processor with interactive effects (crop, resize, blur, add box/text).
- **WebCam.py**: Captures and processes webcam video streams.
- **README.md**: Details features and keyboard controls for video effects.

---

## miniproject-3

- Real-time webcam application for geometric image transformations: translation, rotation, scaling, and perspective changes. Includes keyboard controls for interactive manipulation.

---

## miniproject-4

- Real-time feature matching using ORB and SIFT algorithms with two webcams. Visualizes keypoints, matches, and scores. Allows switching between algorithms during execution.

---

## miniproject-5

- Real-time panoramic photo creation by stitching webcam frames. Uses SIFT for keypoint detection, brute-force matching, homography estimation, and seam blending.

---

## miniproject-6

- Lane detection system for road videos. Applies thresholding, edge detection, Hough Transform, and post-processing to identify and track lane lines in real time.

---

## miniproject-8

- Live object classification using a custom-trained ResNet-50 model. Includes scripts for model training and real-time webcam inference.

---

## miniproject-9

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5. Supports training on custom datasets and running detection on webcam or video files.

---

## miniproject-10

- U-net

---

## miniproject-11

- Combines YOLO object detection with optical flow tracking for robust real-time multi-object tracking. Includes performance metrics and usage instructions.
